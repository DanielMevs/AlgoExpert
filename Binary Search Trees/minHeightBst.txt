Min Height BST
--------------
-Write a function that takes in a non-empty sorted array of distinct integers, constructs
a BST from the integers, and returns the root of the BST.
-The function should minimize the height of the BST 
-It returns the root of that BST
-Insert method is available 
-Height = depth of deepest node (longest branch length)

[1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 22]

-Minimizing the height of a binary tree means we need to make the tree as balanced as
possible.
-We need to minimize the length of both sides / brances s.t. one branch isn't bigger
than another.
-We want the number of nodes in the right subtree to be as equal to the number of nodes 
in the left subtree as possible.
-BST property for any node in a BST, that node's value must be strictly greater than its 
left child and strictly less than or equal to its right child.
-The sorted property of the array implies that the node in the middle has roughly the same
amount of lesser values than greater values.
-If we have a traditional for loop, iterate through the array and add values to the BST,
it would create a tree with in-optimal height.
