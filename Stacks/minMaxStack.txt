Min Max Stack Construction
--------------------------
-Write a MinMaxStack class for a Min Max stack. The class should support:
.Pushing and popping values on and off the stack
.Peeking at the value at the top of the stack
.Getting both the minimum and the maximum values in the stack at any given point
in time.

-All class methods, when considered independently, should run in constant time 
and with constant space.

Sample Usage
//All operations below are performed sequentially
MinStack(): -//instantiate a MinMaxStack

push(5)
getMin(): 5
getMax() : 5
push(7)
getMin() : 5
getMax() : 7
peek(): 7
push(2)
getMin(): 2
getMax(): 7
peek:2
pop() : 2
pop() : 7
getMin() : 5
getMax() : 5
peek() : 5

Ex of a stack: a pile of books on a table 
-We have a table and we start piling books on the table.
-We start with the purple book
-Then we put the greeen book on the purple book
-Then we're going to put a brown book above the green book.
-And now we've got our pile of 3 books.
-If we want to look at all the books and look at their covers we can peek at the
one at the top, the brown book
-If we want to peek at the cover of the green book or the purple book, we grab the
brown book, move it off the pile, and now we can peek at the green book.
-When we've got a pile of books on a table, the last book taht we put at the top of
the pile is going to be the first one that we can look at and that we can pop off the pile.
LIFO: last in, first out
-The last book that was put on the table, or the 'last in' item, was teh brown book, and 
it was the first one to be popped off the stack.

Stack: a data structure that is going to follow the structure of the last in, first out.
You're going to be able to pop items off the stack.
-Similarly, we're going to be able to peek at items on the top of the stack following the 
LIFO rule.
-The stack is going to be the opposite of a queue.
-Where a queue is going to be last in last out.
L>The first item you put in the queue is going to be the first one to come out ratehr than
in the stack where the first  item is the last one to come out.

-What is a min-max stack?
L>it's a stack where not only can we peek at and pop values off the stack, but we can 
also access the minimum and maximum values in the stack at any given time.

-The data structure we use to implement the stack is the array.

-Whenever we push a value to the stack, we modify the value of the new min and max.
