Subarray Sort
--------------

-Write a function that takes in an array of at least two integers and that returns an array
of the starting and ending indices of the smallest subarray in the input array that needs to 
be sorted in place in order for teh entire input array to be sorted (in ascending order).
-If the input array is already sorted, the function should return [-1, -1]

Sample Input
------------

array = [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19]

Sample Output
-------------
[3, 9]

-The array that we're going to have to sort is dependent on the final positions of the 
unsorted numbers.
