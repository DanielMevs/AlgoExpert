Four Number Sum
---------------

-Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer
representing a target sum.
-The function should find all quadruplets in the array that sum up to the target sum
and returns a two-dimensional array of all these quadruplets in no particular order.
-If no four number sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.

Sample Input
------------
array = [7, 6, 4, -1, 1, 2]
targetSum = 16

Sample Output
--------------

[[7, 6, 4, -1], [7, 6, 1, 2]] // the quadruplets could be ordered differently.
