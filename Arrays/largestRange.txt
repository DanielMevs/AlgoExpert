Largest Range
--------------

-Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array of length
2 representing the largest range of integers contained in that array.
-The first number in the output array should be the first number in the range, 
while the second number should be the last number in the range.
-A range of numbers is defined as a set of numbers that come right after each other in the set
of real integers.
-For instance, the output array [2, 6] reprsents the range {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, which is a range of
length 5.
-Note that numbers don't need to be sorted or adjacent in the input array in order to form a range.
-You can assume that there will only be one largest range.
