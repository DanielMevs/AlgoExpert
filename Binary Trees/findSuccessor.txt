Find Successor
--------------
-Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree (where nodes have an additional pointer
to their parent node) as well a node contained in that tree and returns the given node's
successor.
-A node's successor is the node to be visited (immediately after the given node) when 
traversing its tree using the in-order tree-traversal technique.
-A node has no successor if it's the last node to be visited in the in-order traversal

-One solution is storing the values in an array, looking for the node and returning the 
node that comes right after.
-Takes O(n) time
-Takes O(n) space
-Can we do better? 

-Second, more optimal soltion.
-All nodes have access to the parent attribute.
*-A node's successor is going to be the left-most node in teh node's right sub-tree.

-What if the input node does not have a right sub-tree?
-We look at it's parent. If te input node is the right subtree of its parent, it cannot
be the successor node.
We then go up the tree until the input node is the left child of a parent.
-If the input node has no children and it is the left subtree of its parent node, its parent 
node is the successor.
These two observations allow us to solve this problem in O(h) time 
-It will be O(1) space.
